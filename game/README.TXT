PROJECT TITLE: 
Dino Dash

GAME DESCRIPTION: 
This is a platform game. The goal is to survive as long as you can. 

Backstory:
   A scientist works feverishly in his lab to unlock the secrets of time travel. He's developed a machine that could potentially transport a living being back in time. Unfortunately, he discovers the long coveted secret of time travel while working inside of his machine. He is transported back to the time of dinosaurs. 
   Upon arriving in this ancient earth, the poor scientist soon realizes that he has arrived on the worst possible date. This is the day the infamous meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs arrived on earth. He must run from a stampede of dinosaurs, who are attempting to escape the meteor themselves (not that there is any hope). Hopefully, he can avoid getting trampled and destroyed by a meteor. If he can survive long enough, maybe he can find a way out of here!
